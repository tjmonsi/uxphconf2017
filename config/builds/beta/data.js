This presentation will provide you with information and resources you can use immediately to start conducting insightful and effective field research. These techniques are especially useful to startup companies who often lack the resources to conduct long, resource-consuming research projects.",

The technology that enabled us to get access to this wealth of information has also equipped us with tools that we can use to be more efficient at extracting the meanings and stories behind it. Availability of numerous visualization tools has resulted to the popularity of increasingly graphical representation of data that in turn, populates displays known as information dashboards. Information dashboards are visual tools that are supposed to help users become more accurate and efficient in interpreting information. It is not enough for information dashboards to be colorful and graphical. In order to fulfill its role of being a tool for accuracy and efficiency, it must be designed with the users in mind. This talk will walk you through the research process of identifying what type of visualization is efficient, effective, and preferred by healthcare providers and patients who have unique needs when they interact with information on a health-dashboard display.

However, quality feedback is difficult to obtain from playtesting sessions without a quality gaming assessment tool. This talk will cover in depth about a new instrument called the Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale (GUESS) that was developed and validated based on the assessments of over 450 unique video game titles across many popular genres. The GUESS can be applied across many types of video games in the industry both as a way to assess what aspects of a game contribute to user satisfaction and as a tool to aid in debriefing users on their gaming experience.

Over the past few decades, the Asian region has exploded in technological growth from cell phone hardware to call centers to software shops. In the Philippines, BPO Industries have went from .075% of GDP in 2000 to 5.4% of GDP in 2012. It is expected to hit almost 10% of GDP in 2017! But where does UX fit into the conversation? In this presentation, Ben Kim from Apical Design will share his thoughts on the State of UX in Asia. He will draw from his experiences hosting several lectures in the region and multiple first-hand interviews with Asian designers. By the end, attendees will have a better understanding of how UX has progressed in the region and the tremendous possibilities moving forward.",

    fullBio: `We’re getting better at understanding users – more teams across Asia are now testing apps and sites with people. However, summative research such as usability testing only tells you if users can complete tasks successfully on the interface. This is useful but not enough, especially if you’re expected to make big improvements with limited resources. To truly determine if your solution solves the problem, if you’re even working on the right problem or how the solution fits into your users’ lives, you also need to conduct formative research such as interviews and ethnographic studies to dive deeper into behaviours, needs and attitudes. We’ll walk through a case study on how I ran contextual inquiries in customer homes with a global health company, and share techniques that you can use to:
<br/>- Talk to users in their natural environments<br/>
- Manage observers during such interviews<br/>
- Engage stakeholders throughout the process`,
